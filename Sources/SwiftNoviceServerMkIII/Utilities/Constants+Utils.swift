We start from the project brief, design, and we build the entire thing together so you can practice for the real thing. This project fetches a list of followers from a GitHub username via a network call and allows the user to set and persist a favorite GitHub user."

In this first video, I will go over what has confused me a lot;  window and document tabs along with editors and how these all fit together.  I'll provide you with some tips for keeping your hands on the keyboard and still be able to navigate your way around."
    static let paulHudson = "The Hacking with Swift tutorial series is designed to make it easy for beginners to get started coding for iPad and iPhone using the Swift programming language. Hacking with Swiftâ€™s teaching style is extremely hands-on, which means nearly everything you learn from me will have a direct, practical application to something we're working on. That way, your brain can see exactly why a certain technique is helpful and you can start using it straight away."
